            <h2>Camera Setup for ANPR</h2>
            Benefits of an ANPR Camera System
ANPR cameras (also known as ALPR in some countries) can monitor any location with cars, from car parks and highways to communities and parks. An ANPR camera can be used as an effective tool to monitor specific locations to mitigate trespassing, vandalism, illegal dumping, and other crimes. As a part of a system, tools like a Number Plate Recognition Camera can take, tag, and store photos and video for later use. The ANPR system then sends alerts in real-time to dispatch resources, collect tolls, allow gated access to pre-approved vehicles, monitor traffic flows by day parts, and much more.

        <h5>What Is ANPR Software For Cameras?</h5>
        <P>
            ANPR, or Automatic Number Plate Recognition, is a specially-created software system that captures number plates in photos and videos. Its secret power is translating those visual images into usable digital data that can be used in multiple scenarios to help improve community safety and security. Typically, an ANPR collects vehicle make, model, and color information as well. Once in useable data form, the information can be stored for future reference, like building cases against those who have broken the law. How well an ANPR correctly identifies number plates varies by software vendor. Most ANPR software evolves over time, getting better and better thanks to the AI engine in use by the software’s creators.
            Factors Impacting ANPR Success
            There are a number of fundamental components that make ANPR successful.  These include:
            
            The camera itself, such as the resolution, IR capabilities, etc.
            Camera setup, such as the angle of placement, zoom/pan, etc.
            ANPR engine, such as the underlying algorithms to identify vehicles and plates.
            Of these three, we see that camera setup holds the most potential for improvement for businesses and consumers to significantly bolster their ANPR results.   We draw this conclusion because we know that our Plate Recognizer ANPR engine has been thoroughly tested and optimized to handle blurry, low-res, and dark images as well as other aspects of the real-world environment.  Feel free to reference the results of our ALPR benchmarking exercise.  Further, counter to claims from camera manufacturers, we see that a modest, mid-range IP camera performs just as well as a high-end, expensive camera.  Now, of course, no LPR camera vendor is going to admit this because they need a way to justify their existence.  From our years of experience supporting and helping clients troubleshoot their license plate recognition systems, we have observed how proper camera setup along with a strong ANPR engine can be an effective solution to detect and decode vehicle license plates.  This article offers specific tips and suggestions on how to best set up your camera to maximize your ANPR.

        <h5>Camera Zoom For The Best ANPR Systems</h5>
        <p>
            For beginners handling license plate recognition, there is a common misconception that a wide-angle shot is the best.  Cameras will seek to aim wide across parking lots rather than towards entrance or exit points, which allow them to truly pick up plates and get a good read. 
            
            This is a simple fix if you know how to fix it. Adjust the camera positioning and width of the focus so that the license plate is picked up in the shot, and you’ll instantly have greater accuracy. Rather than have a wide-angle view of the street with all the homes around it, it is better to focus on just the street itself.
            
            In the photo below, you can find the image with the red box showing the plate. If the camera was zoomed in closer to the gate, the focus would improve. Make sure you are not over-zooming because you’ll need about 100 pixels of width on the license plate in order to get a good LPR read.
            
            If you are in an area using CCTV cameras, Plate Recognizer’s software may still work. While CCTV cameras are typically on the lower end of the quality spectrum, they may still be suitable to capture vehicles moving at low speeds.</p>

        <h5>Sufficient Infrared For Good Night-Time ANPR</h5>
       <p>
        If you have a great ANPR system, but no infrared (IR) light capabilities, you will have a tough time capturing plate numbers at night. This is because when it’s dark, there’ll be glare on the plate from the headlights.  If you’re using ANPR to detect crime, it most often will happen at night so without good infrared lighting, you won’t be able to get the information needed from your ALPR camera.
        
        Infrared cameras utilize LED lights to illuminate the plate area with infrared light, which is invisible to humans.  Cameras with an IR cut filter automatically adjust IR light levels so that you can get consistent colored images in the day time and black/white images at night.
        
        Depending on the exterior lighting, you may be able to get a license plate read at night without IR, but it won’t have the same accuracy. Using IR may also help you pick up images in different weather conditions. For example, if you are in a location that gets a lot of rain, an ANPR system that relies on white and natural light will have a hard time getting accurate images. 
        
        For optimal IR use, you’ll want to place the camera on an angle so it isn’t pointing directly at headlights. This will avoid unnecessary glare risks and ensure you’re getting a good shot of the license plate. 
        
        If your current lpr camera doesn’t have IR, you can always buy a cheap external piece instead of upgrading your entire system. The IR technology built into a camera may also not be enough, so adding another external device can increase accuracy.</p>
